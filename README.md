# Machine Learning Edge Detection Algorithm

### This method is appropriate for edge detection of particle microscopy images.

In this work we show how you can use the Canny edge detector to create an edge detection training set. Then we train a logistic regression algorithm based on this data set and we present the edge detection results on the original image and on two similar images.
